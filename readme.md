# Property Flyers

This is a Laravel application enabling users to create 'flyers' or advertisement pages for real estate properties, inspired by the Laracasts tutorial.
 
Users are able to register, add and edit flyers; including the upload and deletion of associated property images.

### Testing
To facilitate and demonstrate testing, test scripts for use with PHPUnit are included in the *tests* directory. Dummy user and flyer data can be generated with the model factories found in */database/factories/ModelFactory.php*.
